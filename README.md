**FPS Project** is a personal 4th-year endeavor focused on developing core features of a First-Person Shooter using my **custom 3D engine** with **SDL** and **OpenGL**. 

I implemented **AABB collision and physics**, **weapon animations** (idle, fire, reloading), a **raycast system**, robust **AI behaviors** (patrol, detection, attack), a **combat system**, and **AI hit/death animations**.
